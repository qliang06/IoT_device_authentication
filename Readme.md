# Embedded Security Project - Using the Gowin GW1NSE2 for Authentication

- Designed a security authentication application for showing the use of SecureFPGA device
which includes FPGA fabric, ARM microprocessor, and SRAM PUF (Physically Unclonable
Function) security functions.
- Lead the authentication procedure and device communication scheme design.
- Implemented and bug fixing MCU application based on I ntrinsyc I D BroadKey Pro Security
Library using C\C++.
- Selected Node.js as backend technology to share the flow of data with I oT devices via UART.
